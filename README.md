# From-Pounds-to-Pollution-The-Role-of-Income-in-UK-s-CO2-Emissions (Volunteer blog article for the UK-based nonprofit organization, Climate App)

This research examines the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions in the UK, illustrating how economic disparities influence the nation’s environmental footprint. By analyzing income data from 2010 to 2020, sourced from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), and CO2 emissions data from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the study highlights the stark contrast between affluent regions, such as London and the South East, and poorer regions, like the North East and West Midlands. Findings indicate that affluent areas contribute disproportionately to commercial CO2 emissions, while poorer regions are more heavily affected by industrial emissions. Despite these regional differences, overall emissions across the UK have steadily decreased, suggesting that targeted climate action can yield positive results and presenting an opportunity to address both income inequality and environmental degradation simultaneously. This analysis underscores the need for systemic change and collective action to build a sustainable and equitable future for all.
