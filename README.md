# From-Pounds-to-Pollution-The-Role-of-Income-in-UK-s-CO2-Emissions

This research explores the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions in the UK, revealing how economic disparities shape the nation’s environmental impact. By analyzing income data from 2010 to 2020, sourced from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), and CO2 emissions data from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), we highlight the stark contrast between affluent regions, such as London and the South East, and poorer regions, like the North East and West Midlands. The study finds that while affluent areas contribute disproportionately to commercial CO2 emissions, poorer regions are dominated by industrial emissions. Despite these regional differences, overall emissions across the UK have steadily decreased. This suggests that targeted climate action can yield positive results, presenting an opportunity to address both income inequality and environmental degradation simultaneously. Through this analysis, the research emphasizes the need for systemic change and collective action to build a sustainable and equitable future for all.
